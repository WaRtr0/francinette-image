# Security Policy for Francinette-image

## Spotted a Bug?

Hey there! If you stumble upon a security bug in the installer, it is crucial to warn me. I think, we all want to keep our development environment squeaky clean, right? But if you find the bug in Francinette itself, you gotta reach out to [xicodomingues](https://github.com/xicodomingues).

### How to Report a Bug?

- **If it's in the installer**: Shoot me an email at (mmorot@student.42lyon.fr)[mmorot@student.42lyon.fr] with all the nitty-gritty details. The more precise, the better.
- **If it's in Francinette**: Since our installer always fetches the latest version of Francinette, any oddities there should be reported directly to xicodomingues.
- **Don't you know where the bug is?**: Hit me up anyway. I might put the repo on hold to investigate.

### What's Next?

1. I'll get back to you as soon as I get your email.
2. I'll dive into the issue and get cracking on a fix.
3. Once patched up, I'll roll out an update, and you will have the gratitude of the large community of 42.

### Disclosure Protocol:

We'll keep the details under wraps until the issue is ironed out. After that, we'll spill the beans with full transparency.

Many thanks for your contribution!
